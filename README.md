# Data Pipeline with Spark, Iceberg, Hive, Trino, Superset & Airflow

## üìã Overview

This project implements a modern, scalable ETL pipeline using Apache Spark, Apache Iceberg, Hive Metastore, and Trino ‚Äî all orchestrated with Apache Airflow and powered by object storage via MinIO. It enables structured data ingestion, transformation, and analysis with support for large-scale queries and dashboarding tools like Superset.

---

## üîÅ Pipeline Flow

### 1. **Extract CSV Data from MinIO**

- Raw sales data is stored as CSV files in a MinIO bucket.
- A Spark job reads these files (`extract.py`).
- Additional metadata is added (e.g., `ingestion_date`, `source_file`).
- Output is written as partitioned **Parquet** files to a *warehouse* bucket.

### 2. **Transform & Structure**

- Spark reads the previously generated Parquet files (`transform.py`).
- Schema is explicitly defined with typed columns (e.g., `INT`, `STRING`, `DATE`).
- Simple transformations and cleanups are applied (e.g., date parsing, formatting).
- The output is written to an **Apache Iceberg** table using the **HiveCatalog**.

### 3. **Catalog with Hive Metastore**

- Tables are registered in Hive Metastore, enabling query engines like Trino to discover them.
- The warehouse path is configured as an S3-compatible bucket in MinIO.

### 4. **Query & Analyze with Trino**

- Trino connects to Hive Metastore and reads Iceberg tables directly.
- Business logic and aggregation queries (e.g., sales per product per month) are executed.
- Results can be consumed by visualization tools like **Apache Superset**.

### 5. **Business Intelligence (BI) with Superset**

- Apache Superset is connected to Trino as a SQL source.
- It enables rich visual dashboards and data exploration over the Iceberg tables.
- Business users can analyze product performance, seasonal trends, and historical sales via an interactive UI.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

| Component        | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Apache Spark** | ETL: Reading, transforming, and writing data |
| **MinIO**        | S3-compatible object storage for raw & parquet data |
| **Apache Iceberg** | Table format with support for versioning, partitioning |
| **Hive Metastore** | Catalog and schema registry for Iceberg    |
| **Trino**        | Distributed SQL engine for analytics         |
| **Apache Airflow** | Workflow orchestration of the entire pipeline |
| **Superset**     | BI and dashboard visualization               |

## üöÄ Use Cases

- Automated ETL pipelines on raw sales data
- Centralized, queryable warehouse with Trino
- BI dashboards for business teams in Superset
- ML-based forecasting on cleaned sales data

## üìä Example Dashboard Insights

Superset dashboards can be created to visualize:

- Monthly sales trends per product line
- Top-performing product categories
- Forecasted vs. actual sales using ML models
- Data quality reports for pipeline monitoring

## üìù Notes

- Trino and Superset connect directly to Iceberg via Hive Metastore ‚Äî no traditional RDBMS is needed.
- Partitioning and Z-ordering are applied to Iceberg tables for query efficiency.
- Forecast results from ML models are also stored in Iceberg for unified analysis.

## üß™ Example Query in Trino

```sql
SELECT
  PRODUCTLINE,
  MONTH(orderDate) AS order_month,
  SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM iceberg.db.sales
GROUP BY PRODUCTLINE, MONTH(orderDate);
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

All services needed to run the pipeline are provided in a single Docker Compose file.

- `make up`: Starts all services in the Docker Compose file.
- `make down`: Shuts down all services and removes all images in the Docker Compose file.
- `make logs`: Follows the logs of the running services.
